The table called "Criteria.csv", in the github repository called "Criteria", which is at the web address "https://github.com/juliaceae/Criteria", was originally created by Kara Goodwin (DEQ LEAD) during summer 2013.  It includes 687 toxic chemicals and the associated criteria or benchmarks established DEQ and EPA (if available).  

Since the table was originally created, the DEQ toxics criteria in Tables 30 and 40 were updated by DEQ, and the DEQ CRITERIA WERE UPDATED in the file called "Criteria.csv".  Peter Bryant updated the DEQ criteria as part of the Intergrated Report effort.  However, EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) also updated their benchmarks, and the OPP BENCHMARKS WERE NOT UPDATED in the file called "Criteria.csv".

The original metadata for the column information is described in the email quoted below.  "[]" indicate added notations.

"Hi Julia,
Yes, I did generate this spreadsheet and it’s pretty messy…sorry about that.  
It was built last summer and hasn’t been updated since.  The latest EPA OPP updates are not included.  
Peter Bryant has some R code for pulling information out of this spreadsheet to relate to data. 

Here’s some reference information:
Data from Table 40 & 20 [columns 9-12]
blank cells in the lighter shade indicate that the chemical was not found in this data source

Data from OPP- Aquatic life benchmarks retrieved 26 Sep 2012. webpage last update 30 May 2012. http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/aquatic_life_benchmark.htm#benchmarks [columns 15-22]blank cells in the lighter shade indicate that the chemical was not found in this data source

Data from EPA Human Health Benchmarks for Pesticides. Data retrieved 30 Aug 2012. http://iaspub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=HHBP:home published April 2012? [columns 35-36]blank cells in the lighter shade indicate that the chemical was not found in this data source

Data are Fish Screening Values based on 3 different consumption rates [columns 37-39]
blank cells in the lighter shade indicate that the chemical was not found in this data source

These row need to be looked at. Many have the same chemical name with different CAS numbers.  Some even have different criteria associated with them
Others are groups of chemicals that have similar names/numbers and may need to be consolidated. 


These rows contain data from different sources where the chemical was the same, but the name was listed differently.  The alternate name was added to the "alias" column
